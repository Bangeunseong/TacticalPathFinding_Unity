# Tactical Pathfinding Demo
This repository is created for study purpose.

## How it works?
Calculates danger score of each tile in initialized grid.

Then, calculate path to destination using Heuristic & Cost calculation determined by enemy detection radius.

Finally, single entity will go to destination by passing node to node.
